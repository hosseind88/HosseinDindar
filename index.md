## Hi! I'm Hossein Dindar

I'm a frontend engineer that loves to create performant web applications with high quality and also
always researching about new technologies in web development. Now I am following WebAssembly topic and doing some stuff with it.
I am using it with Rust language as I love it. I have also contributed to rust language compiler.
